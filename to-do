To-Do:


1. Check over README to see if anything else needs to be added

Marium (all of these sections go at the beginning):
* Adding to motivation (why you want to use this -- why we chose to do it)
* How it works (function that calls parameterized report + what is a parameterized report and why is it cool)
* Conditions you need to have in your dataset for the report to actually work

Audrey:
* Note about where the cutoffs came from for Rhat and N_eff
* Future work section explaining extention to multiple regression and why we're not doing it


2. See if we can accept things like x = temp_feel instead of x = "temp_feel" (highly optional)
3. Draft up our final PDF submission

-- pass it off to someone else to see if they have any suggestions for improvements


Questions for Miles:

1. What is the best/recommended way for us to submit the project? A pdf with a link to the repository (and a summary of the files within)?

-- pdf with link to repo and instructions of which order miles should look @ stuff

2. What kind of stuff should we add to our README? Maybe a short summary of motivation for the project

-- maybe a short summary of parameterized reports and their utility
-- in which situations you'd use it
-- add a note about how we decided when things are too extreme
-- add a note about why we decided to not do multiple regression




3. Order of sections in the output. Currently, they just follow the order in the textbook/the order we learned them. Is there a more logical order?
