To-Do:


1. README + sample output HTMLs (just need to add section at bottom about which bits are customized for each report)
2. See if we can accept things like x = temp_feel instead of x = "temp_feel" (highly optional)
3. Get hex sticker looking beautiful. Current code below

library(hexSticker)
sticker("bayes.png", package = "", s_x = 1.05, s_width = 0.85, s_y = 1, h_color = "#00134A", h_fill = "#5693C2", url = "Bayesian Regression \n           w/ snr()", u_size = 2.6, u_x = 0.25, u_y = 1.35, filename = "hex.png")
