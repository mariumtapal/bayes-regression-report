To-Do:


1. Check over README to see if anything else needs to be added
2. See if we can accept things like x = temp_feel instead of x = "temp_feel" (highly optional)
3. Draft up our final PDF submission


Questions for Miles:

1. What is the best/recommended way for us to submit the project? A pdf with a link to the repository (and a summary of the files within)?

2. What kind of stuff should we add to our README? Maybe a short summary of motivation for the project

3. Order of sections in the output. Currently, they just follow the order in the textbook/the order we learned them. Is there a more logical order?
