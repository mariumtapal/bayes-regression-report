To-Do:


1. Check over README to see if anything else needs to be added
2. See if we can accept things like x = temp_feel instead of x = "temp_feel" (highly optional)
3. Get hex sticker looking beautiful. Old code with a title:

library(hexSticker)
sticker("bayes.png", package = "", s_x = 1.05, s_width = 0.85, s_y = 1, h_color = "#00134A", h_fill = "#5693C2", url = "Bayesian Regression \n           w/ snr()", u_size = 2.6, u_x = 0.25, u_y = 1.35, filename = "hex.png")

Code with no title:

 sticker("Images/bayes.png", package = "", s_x = 1.05, s_width = 0.9, s_y = 1.1, h_color = "#00134A", h_fill = "#5693C2", filename = "Images/hex.png")


4. Final submission is in a pdf format. We could just add the required information including twitter handles onto the REAME, knit it to a pdf instead of a github doc and submit that. 

The instructions for submission (as on moodle) are:

You can submit a pdf with your project write up or a pdf with links to the appropriate webpages. Also please submit a file in which you declare if you:
1.) Are alright with your project being shared with the rest of the class
2.) Are alright with your project being shared on the internet (if so, please include twitter handles if you have them)
